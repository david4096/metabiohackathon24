# Genome variation

This abstract should be suitable for reporting results to the wider bioinformatics community.

Title: Unified Handling of Heterogeneous Genomic Data through Pangenome Graphs

Abstract:

The proliferation of genomic data from sequencers has led to an overwhelming volume of genetic variations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variations. While simple variations are being integrated into TogoVar, standardization of structural variations remains a challenge. In contrast, pangenome graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for integrating multiple haplotypes. This hackathon aims to discuss a unified approach for handling this heterogeneous genomic data, leveraging the potential of pangenome graphs to consolidate disparate genetic information. We propose the development of a consensus pangenome graph tool, building on existing resources such as Genome Variation Ontology (GVO) and the Variatio representation framework by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). This initiative will facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of human genomic variation, ultimately contributing to improved genetic analysis and interpretation.### Note:

# Pangenome Graphs Database (PGD)

 
Here is an abstract that reports our results:

Title: Pangenome Graphs Database: A Repository for Collecting and Analyzing Existing Pangenomes

Abstract:
We present the Pangenome Graphs Database (PGD), a centralized repository collecting existing pangenomes from various organisms, including humans, primates, and plants. By surveying 609 published papers with the term "pangenome" and utilizing GitHub, we have gathered draft versions of pangenome graphs into a single database. Our PGD stores metadata in JSON format, which can be easily converted to JSON-LD, and features a SPARQL endpoint for querying. We provide access to raw data, assembled haplotype sequences, and links to the original publications, along with information on availability, licenses, methods, authors, references, and versions. The PGD aims to facilitate analysis of pangenomes in various environments, including cloud and on-premise systems, and has been submitted to the BioHackrXiv for peer review. This resource will aid in advancing our understanding of genomic diversity and its applications in bioinformatics.

# Integrating facial analysis into

 

This study describes an integration of facial analysis capabilities into PubCaseFinder, a framework for searching for disorders, genes, and patients based on Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) analysis. The GestaltMatcher Database (GMDB), containing over 10,000 facial images associated with rare disorders, is linked to PubCaseFinder. By inputting a facial image and HPO terms, the system generates a list of suggested disorders, genes, and patients, along with links to the corresponding photo in GMDB for further investigation. The study demonstrates this functionality using test data from GMDB and published Japanese patient cases from online sources. This integration aims to enhance diagnostic assistance using facial photos and facilitate collaboration within the bioinformatics community. Abstract submitted by Tzung-Chen Hsieh. 2 pages.

Title: Analyzing PubCaseFinder Queries for Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) Suggestion and Bias Detection

Abstract:
This study aims to improve the accuracy of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) term suggestions by analyzing the log of PubCaseFinder queries.

# Hidden-Rad ontology

 

Title: Development of Hidden-Rad Ontology for Radiology Disease Decision Process

Abstract:

We present the development of the Hidden-Rad ontology, a structured representation of radiology disease decision processes based on chest X-ray data from MIMIC. This ontology aims to explain why certain diseases are identified in radiology reports by incorporating expert-confirmed checklist information that is typically not included in these reports. Leveraging large language models and crowdsourcing, we generated training data for the Hidden-Rad ontology, which integrates base ontologies (FMA, RadLex, DOID, MONDO) with properties from RadGraph and specially required schema elements for checklists. The resulting ontology provides a comprehensive framework for understanding radiology disease decision-making processes, enhancing transparency and accuracy in radiology report generation. This innovation has the potential to improve the reliability of radiology reports by providing a structured explanation for disease impressions, which can be particularly valuable in clinical settings where accurate diagnosis is critical. ### End Response ## Step 1: Understand the task

# Viral phylogenomics

Abstract:
Viral phylogenomics: Rebuilding the Tree of Life for viruses

The conventional approach to building species trees relies on universal marker genes, which are not present in viruses. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that clusters gene trees by topology and builds species trees for taxonomic groups with compatible gene trees.

By leveraging the IMG/VR dataset, the largest collection of viral genomes (5,576,197), our workflow, kizuchi, generates gene trees using prodigal-gv, hmmer, mafft, trimal, and fasttree. This approach enables us to study recombination among viruses and their hosts, test models of species concepts in viruses, and shed light on the origin of cellular and viral life.

Our method provides a crucial step towards reconstructing the Tree of Life for viruses, with far-reaching implications for understanding the evolution and diversity of this vast and complex group.  (146 words) ### Step 1: Determine the main goal of the abstract.

# Cultivation media & phenotypic traits

 Title: Standardizing Cultivation Media Ontology for Enhanced Data Exchange and Phenotypic Trait Analysis.

Abstract:

Here, we describe our efforts to standardize the cultivation media ontology by aligning and expanding terminologies between two platforms, MediaDive and TogoMedium. This collaboration aimed to develop an exchange format for media data between the two platforms, allowing for more efficient information sharing and comparison. By manually and automatically aligning terminologies, we have established a foundation for integrating additional information on media design and calculating similarity between media. Furthermore, we have initiated cleansing of phenotypic trait data and test data. Ultimately, our work seeks to facilitate the use of artificial intelligence in predicting cultivation media, which will be explored if time allows. This project has significant implications for the wider bioinformatics community, as standardization of cultivation media ontology can improve data sharing, analysis, and prediction capabilities, leading to advancements in biological research and application.

# GLYCO and all things sweet!

Title:Clarifying Glycan Definitions for Bioinformatics Community

Abstract:

Glycans, the complex sugar molecules found in cells, have been a long-standing challenge in bioinformatics due to their lack of clear and distinguishable definitions. This study aims to address this issue by analyzing data from GlyTouCan, a comprehensive glycan structure repository. By examining the structures considered glycans versus those classified as monosaccharides, we seek to establish rules for defining glycan structures. Our findings will have significant implications for bioinformatics research, enabling more accurate identification and analysis of glycan data. Furthermore, this study contributes to the development of GlyCosmos, a platform facilitating glycan-related information exchange, through updates on archetypes, subsumption, motifs, and RDF integration. The ultimate goal is to establish a standardized framework for glycan classification, promoting harmonization across bioinformatics tools and advancing our understanding of these vital molecules.
